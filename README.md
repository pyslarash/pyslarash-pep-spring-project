# Spring social media blog API

## Description 

This project serves as the backend for a hypothetical social media app, focused solely on managing user accounts and their submitted messages. While it doesn't include a frontend, it leverages the Spring framework for its robust features, including dependency injection, automatic configuration, and CRUD operations.
